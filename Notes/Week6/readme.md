# Final-week css notes

- font-face => (family and url) ```@font-face{font-family:font-name; src:url(./.tff)}```
- each font extension indicates how it works on different browsers
- selecting attributes with attribute selector ```img[id], section[id]```
- start with (^)
- Attribute in html, ```data-interval="3```
- Scroll-behavior,```scroll-behavior:smooth;``` but has major problems in browsers compatibility, so we use nice scroll by jquery
