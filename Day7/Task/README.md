Problems I faced during making the projects:

- (Background-image) problem => didn't link css stylesheet
- (Make background fixed) problem=> use background-attachment:fixed (<https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36679649/how-to-add-a-color-overlay-to-a-background-image>)
- (Overlay div color) problem => used dev tools to inspect bg-color of bootstrap and then found the opacity percent
- (Ordering the navbar items) problem => solved it using flex-container  justify-content: space-between
- (typed js alternative in css) problem => <https://codepen.io/pmallol/pen/gOaEvJG>
- (make text aligned)
